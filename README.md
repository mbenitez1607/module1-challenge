# Module 1: HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor, Accessibility

## Description

This project was initiated from the provided [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram). It is supposed to be the codebase from a Marketing Agency called Horiseon that wants us to ensure the code follows the accessibility standards.

The main tasks to complete the project ensured that:
- HTML uses the proper semantic elements
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of position / style
- Images have 'alt' attributes
- CSS selectors/properties are consolidated, organized, and properly documented with comments
